    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>When I think of home, I think back when I went to Lala's over in Newport. This dish is a callback to those days, with a creamy sauce and tender chicken that always makes you smile no matter how rotten the days of working the docks were. It's good eating. </p>
    <p>You gotta start with the basics. Let's go.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley sprig (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Remove from skillet and let rest.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt butter and add minced garlic. Saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook fettuccine according to package instructions. Drain and add to the sauce, tossing to coat.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken and serve it on top of the pasta. Garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
