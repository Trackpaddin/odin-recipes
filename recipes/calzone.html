    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><em>Calzone</em> is a delightful Italian dish that brings the flavors of pizza into a portable, hand-held form. It's perfect for a quick meal or a cozy night in. Let's get started on making this delicious treat. I have another night of working the docks after, so we're in a hurry.</p>
    <p>Alright, let's roll up our sleeves and get cooking. Grab your ingredients and let's make some calzones.</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water (110째F or 43째C)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooked and crumbled Italian sausage (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce (for dipping)</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="instructions">
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture. Knead until a smooth dough forms. Cover and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a circle about 6 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and cooked sausage (if using). Spoon the filling onto one half of each dough circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the other half over the filling and press the edges to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.</li>
        <li>Place the calzones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with beaten egg for a golden finish.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with marinara sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
